        >The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the
        home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us
        nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom
        window.</span

        >This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot
        like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were
        surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</span

      ><span
        >The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days
        exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants,
        and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</span
