    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>
    <p>
      This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called
      <i>sous vide</i>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
      in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In
      his book, <b> <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> </b>, Jeff Potter describes it as
      "ultra-low-temperature poaching".
    </p>
    <p>
      Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a
      seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.
